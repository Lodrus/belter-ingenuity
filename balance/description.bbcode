This is a tiny mod meant to balance the game when using the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238802112]Belter Ingenuity[/url] collection. Specifically, it helps when using the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1845977557]AQD - Vanilla Ore Distribution[/url] and [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1191589902|Jetpack Limit - Low Power, Small Tanks[/url] mods together and even moreso when using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542310718]AwwScrap[/url] as well.

When using this particular collection of mods, cobalt is difficult to find and incredibly hard to access in the early game. This significantly slows down the early game progression basically until you've dug a very deep hole with limited resources. Similarly, you also cannot easily access magnesium which is needed to buid ammo to defend constructions. Belter Ingenuity Balance solves this problem by enabling the survival kit to refine very tiny amounts of cobalt and Magnesium from stone.
